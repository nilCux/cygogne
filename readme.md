## Introduction  
Cygogne is a prototype API designed to enable users to access a stable-diffusion Text-To-Img service. This can be done by utilizing predefined prompt-templates. The API's endpoints are specifically optimized for a collection of templates categorized based on content themes. While users have the option to partially customize these templates, Cygogne strikes a balance by sacrificing the flexibility of generating any content or using any prompt. Instead, it aims to provide users with straightforward generation of high-quality results within our predefined themes, eliminating the need for parameter tuning.
